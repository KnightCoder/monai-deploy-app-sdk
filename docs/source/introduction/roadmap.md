# Roadmap

**v0.1.0** is focusing on implementing MVP to give you a sense of what MONAI Deploy App SDK's API would look like, focusing on the disk input/output.

The next version (v0.2.0) would come with more features such as supporting [NVIDIA Triton Inference Server](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server).
