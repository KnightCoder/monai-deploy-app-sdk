# Deploying to the remote server (coming soon)

As of v0.2.0, the SDK is not yet ready to deploy to the remote server (MONAI Deploy App Server).
We are actively working on it.

Meanwhile, you can use the following tutorial to deploy your model with the RESTful Inference Service -- [MONAI Inference Service (MIS)](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/monai-deploy-app-server/blob/main/components/inference-service/README.md).

Please refer to the following tutorial for more details:
